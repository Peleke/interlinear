## Development Workflow

4. Implement feature with BDD/TDD (write tests first)
5. Mark story complete when all AC met
6. Move to next story

### For Scrum Master
- Use `*draft` command to create detailed stories from epics
- Stories reference PRD and architecture shards
- Each story is dev-ready with code examples

---

## Architecture References

All stories reference sharded architecture docs:
- `/docs/architecture/` - Technical implementation details
- `/docs/prd/` - Product requirements and user stories

---

## Status

**Current Phase:** Story creation complete
**Next Step:** Begin Epic 1, Story 1.1 (Project Initialization)
**Est. Completion:** 48 hours from start
