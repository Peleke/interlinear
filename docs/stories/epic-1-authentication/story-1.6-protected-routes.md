# Story 1.6: Protected Routes & Middleware

## Story
**As a** developer
**I want to** protect `/reader` and `/vocabulary` routes
**So that** only authenticated users can access them

## Priority
**P0 - Day 1, Hour 4**

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Middleware checks auth on protected routes
- [x] Unauthenticated users redirect to `/login`
- [x] Auth state persists on reload
- [x] Authenticated users redirect from auth pages to `/reader`

## Technical Details
Created `middleware.ts` using Supabase SSR middleware pattern with cookie handling. Protects `/reader` and `/vocabulary` routes, redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`, and redirects authenticated users away from `/login` and `/signup` to `/reader`.

## Architecture References
- `/docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md` - Middleware
- `/docs/prd/user-stories.md` - US-103

## Definition of Done
- [x] Protected routes require auth
- [x] Redirects work correctly
- [x] Session persists
- [x] Middleware compiled successfully

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4.5 (20250929)

### Tasks Completed
- [x] Created middleware.ts with Supabase SSR pattern
- [x] Implemented route protection for /reader and /vocabulary
- [x] Added redirect logic for unauthenticated users → /login
- [x] Added redirect logic for authenticated users away from /login, /signup → /reader
- [x] Configured cookie handling for Supabase auth in Edge middleware
- [x] Set up middleware matcher to exclude static assets
- [x] TypeScript type checking passed
- [x] Next.js build successful (middleware: 79.6 kB)

### File List
- `middleware.ts` - Edge middleware with Supabase auth and route protection

### Route Protection Logic
**Protected routes:**
- `/reader` → requires authentication, redirects to `/login` if not authenticated
- `/vocabulary` → requires authentication, redirects to `/login` if not authenticated

**Auth page redirects:**
- `/login` → redirects to `/reader` if already authenticated
- `/signup` → redirects to `/reader` if already authenticated

**Cookie handling:**
- Middleware uses `@supabase/ssr` createServerClient for Edge runtime
- Properly syncs cookies between request and response objects
- Maintains session state across navigation

### Build Output
```
Route (app)                                 Size  First Load JS
┌ ○ /                                      161 B         105 kB
├ ○ /login                               1.76 kB         159 kB
└ ○ /signup                              1.85 kB         159 kB

ƒ Middleware                             79.6 kB
```

### Edge Runtime Warnings
Expected warnings from Supabase Realtime (process.versions, process.version) - these are acceptable as realtime features work client-side, not in middleware.

### Completion Notes
- Build successful: middleware compiled to 79.6 kB
- No TypeScript errors
- Ready for Epic 2: Text Input & Rendering
- Epic 1 Authentication complete: 6/6 stories ✅

### Change Log
- 2025-10-25: Middleware implemented with route protection and auth redirects

### Status
**Ready for Review**
