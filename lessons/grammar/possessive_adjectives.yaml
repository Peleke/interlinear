  ## Possessive Adjectives

  Possessive adjectives show ownership or relationships between people and things.

  ### Singular Forms
  | Person | Spanish | English | Example |
  |--------|---------|---------|---------|
  | 1st person | mi | my | mi padre (my father) |
  | 2nd person | tu | your (informal) | tu hermana (your sister) |
  | 3rd person | su | his/her/your (formal) | su abuela (his/her/your grandmother) |

  ### Plural Forms
  | Person | Spanish | English | Example |
  |--------|---------|---------|---------|
  | 1st person | mis | my (plural) | mis padres (my parents) |
  | 2nd person | tus | your (informal, plural) | tus hermanos (your siblings) |
  | 3rd person | sus | his/her/your (plural) | sus abuelos (his/her/your grandparents) |

  ### Key Rules
  1. **Agreement**: Possessive adjectives agree in NUMBER with the thing possessed, not the possessor
     - mi hermano (my brother) - singular
     - mis hermanos (my brothers) - plural

  2. **No gender agreement**: Unlike regular adjectives, possessives don't change for gender
     - mi padre (my father - masculine)
     - mi madre (my mother - feminine)

  3. **Ambiguity with 'su'**: Since 'su' can mean his/her/your/their, context is important
     - su hermano = his brother, her brother, your brother, or their brother

  ### Common Phrases
  - Mi familia - My family
  - Tu nombre - Your name
  - Su casa - His/her/your/their house
