  - title: "Introducing Yourself"
    content: |
      There are two common ways to introduce yourself in Spanish:

      **1. Using "llamarse" (to be called):**
      - **Me llamo** [name] - My name is [name]
      - **¿Cómo te llamas?** - What's your name?

      **2. Using "ser" (to be):**
      - **Yo soy** [name] - I am [name]
      - **¿Quién eres?** - Who are you?

      Both are correct and commonly used. "Me llamo" is more common for first introductions.

  - title: "The Verb SER for Identity"
    content: |
      The verb **ser** is used to express identity, origin, and characteristics.

      **For Introductions:**
      - Yo soy María - I am María
      - Tú eres Juan - You are Juan

      **For Origin (where you're from):**
      - Soy de Barcelona - I'm from Barcelona
      - ¿De dónde eres? - Where are you from?

      **Polite Expressions:**
      - **Mucho gusto** - Nice to meet you (literally: much pleasure)
      - **Encantado/a** - Delighted (masculine/feminine)

  - title: "Cultural Note"
    content: |
      In Spanish-speaking cultures, greetings often include physical contact:
      - A handshake for formal introductions
      - One or two cheek kisses for friends (varies by country)
      - A warm "mucho gusto" shows politeness and respect

      When introducing yourself, Spaniards are generally warm and friendly. Don't be
      surprised if people ask personal questions quickly - it's a sign of interest!
