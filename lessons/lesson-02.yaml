  - title: "Possessive Adjectives"
    content: |
      Possessive adjectives show ownership or relationships:

      **Singular:**
      - **mi** - my (mi padre, mi madre)
      - **tu** - your informal (tu hermano, tu hermana)
      - **su** - his/her/your formal (su familia)

      **Plural:**
      - **mis** - my (mis padres, mis hermanos)
      - **tus** - your informal (tus abuelos)
      - **sus** - his/her/your formal (sus primos)

      **Key Rule:**
      Possessive adjectives match the NUMBER of what's possessed, not the gender:
      - mi hermano (my brother)
      - mi hermana (my sister)
      - mis hermanos (my siblings)

  - title: "Cultural Note"
    content: |
      Family is extremely important in Spanish-speaking cultures. Extended family
      often lives close together, and multi-generational gatherings are common.

      It's very normal to ask about someone's family early in a conversation - it's
      not considered too personal, but rather a sign of genuine interest.

      **"Familia" includes:**
      - Not just immediate family, but also aunts, uncles, cousins
      - Often very close family friends (considered like family)
      - Strong bonds and frequent family gatherings
